            My dad was the definition of Heart. He put his heart into everything he did and 
            because of that he was invincible. It was like a super power he could just turn on
            or it was just always on and he learned how to control it. It made him fearless in 
            a world where fear controls everything. I could ask him a million times why he wouldnt 
            be scared of this or that and all he would say was "Umm I dont know". I think I figured it out tho.
            It was easy for him to face fearful things was because when he was facing these things as he was defending the 
            people he loved. He never in his life stepped foot into a gym but when the time came he could throw grown 
            men accross rooms, hold their lives in his hands as their feet dangled and kicked trying to reach for the floor. 
            He could barely run because of his limp but somehow always was the first one to you when he saw what was going down.
            If you have not seen the movie "Big Fish", I recommend you watch it. I swear that movie was modeled after my dad.
            He would tell me of people he saved or things he had done that seemed physically not possible for him. As life went
            on people would walk up to and yell "JUAN!!", and they would hug him like he was their gaurdian angel. They  would look
            at me and my siblings and would say things like, "If it wasnt for your dad i would be dead", "Do you know how many times he saved my life",
            "He changed my life". I have never seen a man stand his ground so sturdy with no fear in his heart, only the drive to protect what he loved.
            When he wasnt defying physics to protect people, he was just there. Not everyone has someone who is always there. Growing up I slowly realised
            the privileges i had in a father. He would show up to every wrestling match, he was at every show i played, he knew how to console ones heart when
            it was broken. The kids around our neighborhood would call him "Uncle Juan", I didnt realize it at the time but he was a father figure to everyone.
            He would believe in you full heartedly, telling you that the greatness that you are and the greatness that you want is right in front of you, all you
            have to do it reach out for it and claim it. Its there for you. He was so encouraging you felt like you could do anything. When i would fail at things
            i would get so angry and emotional and he would see right through it. He would tell me " Mijo, its okay. Dont worry about it." and for whatever reason 
            that was enough. it wasnt the words he was saying it was the love he was putting into these words that made you feel like everything was gonna be okay.
            He just knew how to be exactly who you needed when you needed it. He had patience and did everything he could to understand you and your needs.
            Everything about this man was a miracle, they told him he would never walk, and walk he did. The doctors would say it doesnt make sense that he can walk
            because of the way the polio shaped his leg. he fought his whole life for everything that he had. in his late years he was diagnosed with ALS, and for 
            five years he fought these disease head on. He would say "im gonna fight this, im not giving up", and when any of us showed to the house crying because of what
            was going on, he would be confused. He would ask us why we are crying and when we would tell him he was just worried about us, he would always put us before him.
            Everything about my dad made him an impossibly good man. It would be like reading something out of a book or from a movie. Ill end with this, My dad told me, 
            "If you ever find yourself in a situation you need to stand your ground, stare them in the eyes and dont look away not even for a second. More times then not they 
            will break and back off." those words were some of the truest words ill ever here. He always led by example, and for those last five years he was battling ALS, he
            stared death in the eyes and didnt look away. He faced his death with no fear and never looked away, not even for a second.
